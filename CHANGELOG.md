## Unreleased

- Coordinators will dispatch by session: in the background when they can be woken (interactive and `claude --bg`), in the foreground in headless `claude -p` runs, where ending a turn ends the run. Settled by trying it; the evidence is in ADR-0001. ([#2](https://github.com/jhnhnsn/ticket-loop/issues/2))
